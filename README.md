# ðŸš— Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict city MPG (Miles Per Gallon) for cars using various vehicle specifications.

## Requirements
```python
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading
- Loads car dataset from `cars.csv`
- Contains vehicle specifications and fuel efficiency metrics

### 2. Feature Selection
#### Numerical Features:
- Vehicle Dimensions (Height, Length, Width)
- Number of Forward Gears
- Engine Statistics (Horsepower, Torque)

#### Categorical Features:
- Engine Driveline
- Transmission Type
- Fuel Type

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Correlation analysis with visualization
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Feature matrix preparation

### 4. Model Development
- Train-test split (80-20 ratio)
- Model: Multiple Linear Regression
- Target Variable: City MPG

## Visualization
- Correlation Matrix Heatmap
- Feature importance analysis
- Data distribution plots

## Model Evaluation
- Performance metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Test set predictions

## Usage
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Place `cars.csv` in the working directory
3. Run all cells in the notebook sequentially

## Future Improvements
1. Feature scaling implementation
2. Cross-validation
3. Hyperparameter tuning
4. Additional evaluation metrics (RÂ², MAE)
5. Residual analysis
